# Soko Number Game

## Description

Soko Number is a puzzle game built with the React framework. The game consists of 6 challenging levels that will test your problem-solving skills. Each level presents a grid-based puzzle where you need to move numbered tiles to their designated positions.

## How to Play

visit [Soko Number](https://ibrahimhiarea.github.io/Soko-Number/) and have fun.

## Gameplay

- The objective of each level is to arrange the numbered tiles in the correct order.
- You can move a tile by clicking on it. If there is an empty space adjacent to the tile, it will slide into that space.
- You can choose to solve the puzzle manually or use one of the available algorithms.

## Algorithms

Soko Number provides several algorithms to solve the puzzles automatically. These algorithms can be accessed through the game's interface. Here are the available options:

1. Depth-First Search (DFS): This algorithm explores the search space by prioritizing the deepest unexplored nodes until a solution is found.
2. Breadth-First Search (BFS): BFS explores the search space by visiting all neighboring nodes before moving to deeper levels.
3. Uniform Cost Search: This algorithm determines the optimal path by considering the cost of each move and selecting the lowest-cost path.
4. A* Search: A* is an informed search algorithm that evaluates each move based on a heuristic function and the cost of reaching the goal.

## Technologies Used

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- HTML5: The markup language used for structuring the game's interface.
- CSS3: Cascading Style Sheets for visual styling.
